            salvation to those who are cremated on its banks, and accordingly sons pay homage to their fathers by performing the
            "Pithru Tharpanam" ritual on the Karkidaka Vavu day.</p>

        <p>Spread over a cluster of islands, surrounded by beautiful hillocks lies a bird watchers' planet, the Kadalundi
            Bird Sanctuary. Located in Kozhikode, the sanctuary greets its visitors with freshwaters of Kadalundi River.

            visit the place to capture even the minutest movements of the birds in their cameras. The sanctuary finds itself 200 m above the sea level</p>
        <p>The paradise designed for bird lovers also offers you a place in serenity. Away from the city's hustle, you can sit here and relax while you witness the lively playful birds. Moreover, the river flowing inside forms a union with the Arabian Sea at a point called Kadalundi Nagaram. This river houses a variety of fishes, crabs, and mussels. You must visit the Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary in December-April when the forest seems no less than a green blanket. It is the time when you can see most of the birds.</p>
