        <h2> Kannur </h2>
        <img src="./Images/KANNUR.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <p>Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring
            monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the cityâ€™s
            significant role in the spice trade</p>

        <h2> Muzhappilangad Beach </h2>
        <img src="./Images/Muzhappilangad_Drive-in_Beach_Kannur.jpg">
        <br><br>

        <p>The Muzzhapilangad Drive-in Beach at Kannur is one referred to with many superlatives- as the longest drive-in beach
            in the whole of India, as one of the cleanest beaches of Kannur and most importantly, as one of the best drive-in
            beaches that the entire Asian continent has to offer!</p>
        <p>Being Kerala's only drive-in beach, it attracts the attention of many tourists around the year. The whole concept
            of drive-in beaches is that you can drive right on the sandy shores of the beach- it is not very often that you
            get to drive along a 4 km long shoreline that offers an open road with no traffic and a stunning view.</p>
        <p>Treat the adrenaline junkie in you and go out for some paragliding, parasailing, powerboating and many other water sports.
            The Muzzhapilangad Drive-In Beach is the perfect weekend getaway to blow off some steam and spend quality time with your loved ones.</p>
        <p>The temple is old one most of tourists visits here for holy inspiration as visible at the bottom is the granite Shivalinga
            of Srimath Anantheshwara after whom the temple is named.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2> St Angelo Fort </h2>
        <img src="./Images/st_angelo_fort_kannur.jpg">
        <br><br>

        <p>St Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric
            structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and
            unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.</p>
        <p>St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well
            as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor,
            Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the
            history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen. There are
            tombstones of the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the fort, barracks and an old chapel here that you can explore. Kannur's first ever lighthouse also stands next
            to the fort and adds to its already hypnotic glory.</p>

        <h2> Parassinikkadavu Snake Park </h2>
        <img src="./Images/Parassini_SnakePark_Kannur.JPG">
        <br><br>
        <p>Regarded as one of the finest snake sanctuaries of Asia, the Parassinikadavu Snake Park is the pride of the south. It is one of the most prominent reptile preservation centres in
            the country and is the only one in Kerala. The Parassinikadavu Snake Park is home to over 150 different species of reptiles like crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes- both
            venomous and non-venomous. Not only reptiles and amphibians, but this snake park also goes a long way to preserve and protect many wild mammals, marine creatures as well as rare
            avifauna- both endemic and migratory.</p>
